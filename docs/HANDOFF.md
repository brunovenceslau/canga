# Handoff notes

This file is the durable record for decisions that must survive past a single
sandbox session: findings the operator explicitly declined (with the
agreement quoted), and process debriefs from rework that a better process
would have prevented. Entries are appended in chronological order, oldest
first, grouped by the pull request they came from.

## PR #26: verify `sbx` CLI flags before writing docs

The `sbx` CLI is not installed inside the sandbox, so any flag or CLI-surface
claim about `sbx` (for example, `sbx env run --clone --auto-approve`) must be
verified against operator-supplied `sbx ... --help` output, never guessed.

## PR #29 (closes #27): declined findings and ship-gate rework debrief

PR #29 ("chore(sbx-kit-pin): address ship-gate follow-ups from #27") closed
out the remaining follow-ups from the sbx-kit pin's ship gate opened in
PR #27. Two findings from its own ship gate were declined by the operator,
and the ship gate itself surfaced a process defect worth recording.

### Declined findings (operator-accepted)

Both findings target the sbx-kit pin surface (`scripts/sbx-kit-pin.sh` and
`sbxkitpin_test.go`):

1. `security-auditor` (Low): sanitize `${seen}` before printing it to stderr
   in the `check-clobber` refusal. Declined: the value comes from gh's own
   lookup, and it goes to the operator's terminal, not a shell or a log
   parsed elsewhere. GitHub repository names are restricted to
   `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, so no terminal-escape injection is expressible through
   this value.
2. `test-engineer` (Info): no test for "gh succeeds with an empty name".
   Declined: the current gh stub cannot express that case, and the
   `${seen:-nothing}` default already covers the refusal message for it.

Operator agreement (2026-09-26): "vou seguir sua recomendação nos 2 decisions
pendentes"

### Rework debrief: verifier tree not frozen during the round-2 ship gate

During PR #29's round-2 ship gate, the builder node edited the tree twice
while the round-2 `test-engineer` verifier was still running, violating the
"verifying subagents freeze their tree" rule. The `test-engineer` noticed the
mismatch and re-verified the converged state, and `make ci` was rerun clean
afterward, so nothing shipped unaudited - but the baseline the verifier had
started against was invalidated mid-review, and the re-verification cost an
extra round that a frozen tree would not have needed.

Lesson: the builder must not write to the tree while any verifier is out;
collect all verdicts first, then apply them in one write pass.

Per house rule, every such lesson asks whether a static tool closes the
class. Proposed (not implemented) mechanical guards, either of which would
turn this into a detectable violation instead of a caught-by-luck one:

- Each verifier records `git rev-parse HEAD` plus a content fingerprint
  (`git status --porcelain` and `git diff | sha256sum`) at the start and end
  of its run, and voids its own verdict if either differs.
- The builder snapshots the tree hash when it dispatches verifiers, and
  refuses to apply any verdict whose recorded baseline hash no longer
  matches the tree at apply time.
